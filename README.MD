# Defensive Coding with Typescript

This project is a TypeScript application. The main entry point of the application is `index.ts`.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Node.js
- npm

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies

## Running the application

To run the application in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start the application in development mode, with hot-reloading enabled. Any changes you make to index.ts (or any other files) will automatically trigger a restart of the application.
